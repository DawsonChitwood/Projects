This is my squat counter program. It involves a python program communicating with an Arduino device (M5-Stick) via Bluetooth to 
register when squat repetitions have been completed. The python program utilizes computer vision to register when the user has passed
certain position thresholds and uses the M5 to allow the user to start/stop the counting process. You can find the source code for
both the Python and M5 programs in their respective folders.
